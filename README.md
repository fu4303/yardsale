All the content is being pulled from `itemsToSellData.json`, so I could update its state easily from an iOS device.

## Mega disclaimer
This site sucks, put together quickly, and abandoned right after — it also has some not-valuable yet personal information, so I'm trusting the good people of the internet to not be creepy. 

Open-sourcing it just because some people might benefit from it.
